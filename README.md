# Do You Have The GUTS 2016

A laser tag game for iOS and android, created for the GUTS hackathon 2016.

The game consists of iOS and Android apps, and a small server to coordinate and do the calculations!

Players aim by pointing their device at their target, and then fire using the fire button! A map shows nearby targets to
aid with aiming. Points will be added if they hit their target. Players can also use a special EMP power-up to hide the map 
of other players!
